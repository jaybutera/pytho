### What is it
A small wrapper of the [paperqa](https://github.com/whitead/paper-qa) python library into a cli tool. You can feed pytho a corpus of text data and ask questions from it.

### How To Use
If you have a directory `./data` with a bunch of text and pdf files,
```bash
python pytho.py
```
If the data directory is located somewhere else
```bash
python pytho.py -d /var/example/data
```

### To note
- Currently its loading the data every time it starts which is why it takes a while. Soon I'll pickle the Docs object and save it to disk to speed that up.
- Every query costs money (usually a few cents) so be mindful with your usage.
